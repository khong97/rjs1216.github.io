	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<img src="EARPhoto.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright" />
	<p>Hi my name is Arjun Sachdev (but you can call me RJ) and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
	In high school, I played baseball and was the head sports anchor for my school's television news program.
	My hobbies include videography, running, and playing guitar. </p>

	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigMobile and SigMusic, guitar club, and boxing club. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
